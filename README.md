answers for the repeat assessment 

A)	In a project like this one that would be better go for Agile development method. This methodology fits better with the project as it has time constraints and the project has a considered short dead line. Using agile methodologies you can focus on iterative development which makes the delivery of the project faster as same as collaboration and Communication, another tactic from the agile methodology that emphasizes a close collaboration between the development team and the client. During the project you are going to come across with regular meetings, reviews and feedbacks. In terms of flexibility and adaptability, agile methods is another positive point for this kind of project as it is easier to handle changes through iterative planning and regular feedback it also makes part of the Agile methodologies as guarantee quality assurance during the development process of the project. With all these featuring that The agile development method has you can see that it would be a good one to choose for this project from the requirements that It has from the client. 


B)	Requirements Gathering: It is the process to collect and the client’s requirements as functional and also non-functional and document all.
Analysis and Planning: After documenting all the requirements it is time to analyse them all to identify the project scope to start creating a development plan.
Design: That is the part that the development team starts to think and create the design of the project always based on the client’s requirements and any improvements you can also implement to the project.
Implementation: Here the development time is creating the actual code based on the design and also the client’s requirements. 
Testing: integration, unit, system or user acceptance testing are crucial before delivering the project to see any issues that has to be fixed or any changes.
Deployment: Packing the whole software do deploy in a environment to see if everything is working perfectly. 
Maintenance and Support: Provide continuous maintenance and support as bug fixing or any further updates needed.


C)	Requirement Document Dorset Hospital System:

Functional Requirements:
-	Login/Register page for user/administrator

    def cancel(self, bookings):

G) 
•	Requirements Validation:  Make sure that all the requirements are included in the project to reach the client’s desire. Meetings with the client is important during the process to make sure that everything is going well or for any changes that has to be done before the final result.
•	Design Verification: Review the all final design of the system and ensure it also matches with the requirements. 
•	Code Verification: try to Perform code to ensure that everything is working perfectly.
•	System Testing: Testing to validade the integration and interaction between the system and the user is working between them, It includes performance, security, user acceptance and functional testing in general. You should basically see if the process of making appointments are working well between users and administrator.
•	Deployment Verification: Verify the successful deployment of the Hospital Appointment system on whatever environment it is.
•	User Acceptance Testing: Collaborate with the client to conduct user acceptance testing, allowing them to verify if the system matches with them previous requirements.
•	Bug fixing: Continuous support for any further issues, bugs, improvements and updates  needed for the system.
Bug Fixing and Iterative Improvements: Address any issues or bugs identified during the validation and verification process. Continuously improve the system based on feedback from stakeholders and end-users
